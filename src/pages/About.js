                <h3>Why I Code</h3>
                <p>
                    I've always been fascinated by systems.
                    The interplay of components which yields an end result.
                    I enjoy constructing such systems, and seeing how that system can be modified to yield a different, more desirable result.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Coding is equal parts puzzle solving and engineering.
                    Every puzzle solved yields a new machine which affects the universe.
                    There are few endeavors more intrinsically satisfying than that.
            </p>

                <h3>Why I'm a Developer</h3>
                <p>
                    Information is the current frontier for humanity, in a literal sense.
                    All physical land has been explored, and now we're building new lands in an abstract space.
                    Programming is the means to explore and settle that frontier.
                    I want to explore that space, and build it out even further.
            </p>

                <h3>Current Goals and Future Plans</h3>
                <p>
                    I'm currently delving into the business side of web development.
                    I see this as a necessary waypoint toward other, more idealistic goals.
                    No amount of idealism changes the world by itself.
            </p>

                <p>
                    Programming, especially web development, represents real opportunity to affect the world, and even the behaviors and future of mankind itself.
                    I think the potential this represents is often not fully appreciated.
                    I want to push the limits of this opportunity for the betterment of mankind.
